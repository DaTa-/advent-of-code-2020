# Advent of Code 2020
My solutions for the well known programming event [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2020/).

Folder `/src/bin` contains individual solution for each part of a day, some parts are merged into single file, 
`/input` contains every puzzle input, except for days with small input, which is directly hardcoded into a source code.

You can run any solution with `cargo run`, for example:

```
cargo run --release --bin day1_part1
```
